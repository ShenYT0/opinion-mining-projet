So unless you memorize that goal #7 is say exercise daily, you won't even know what you're looking at. Additionally, the streaks are glitchy as hell, and often times do not calculate correctly. Really wish they also had aggregate goals, for example grouping similar goals together and then tracking the success percent for the aggregate. Like say if you have multiple diet goals for no dairy, no gluten, and no sugar, it would be great to group those in the diet category and then see your success there overall and trending graphs. And come on, add some pie charts and the ability to look at graphs in intervals aside from a single month.",1,neutral

It does have some short comings that are irritating to me at least. I use my calendar to keep track of my to do lists. I save them in the Description field. First off the editing features such as bolding, underlining, line numbering, etc don't appear anywhere unless like in my case you accidently discover them by doing a couple of steps of bizarre gymnastics. Once found I loved the features. However the first thing that is annoying is that if you have a long list of things that go past one screen you have to keep scrolling down to access those features. Would be nice if there was a button or tab that would open a stationary bar at the top or a floating window that moves with the screen. Second issue is definitely a software bug having to do with the line numbering. Once a line numbering list has been established and you want to go back to add a new line or change the priority by moving things up and down the system does odd things.",1,neutral

8220,"Is it true that non-premium version soon will loose any way for backup/restore or transfer to another phone? If not true: Please point to me what is the backup/restore way that stays in app in the future. Thanks a lot!. If true: That is really bad news - backup is a basic necessity, so non-premium version will become practically useless on the long term. In addition, premium costs twice as much for a single year than, let's say OsmAnd+ for eternity. And that is a much more complex app + the free version is completely usable within reasonable limits. Tasks is a really nice app (except that swichingt between sublists/lists is unreasonably slow) with some unique and essential features. But this wracks it, it will drive me away. Possibly others too. Not a fair move to reduce base functionality like that. RESPONSE TO STEVEN NOTTAGE'S RESPONSE: That is fair enough, except for one important detail: all the people using your free app are now forced to decide - if they want to have a meaningful app - to pay or search for another app. Premium app should only add features and not restrict free app's capabilities. If you add worthwhile features with a fair pricing, people will buy it. Lots of people spent time to set up their tasking system because the app had the right properties for them, now it looks like they were lured into using the app and then forcing them to pay. I payed for a number of apps (all cheaper than yours btw.), and actually my plan was to pay/donate as soon as the slowness of switching between task lists disappear, because I thought the app is really useful and it deserves support. This change is different. I do not mean you should not ask for payment for cloud backup etc., just that you should not remove the free local backup (or any other feature). Or that you should have omitted it from the free version from the start. Best wishes! RESPONSE TO STEVEN NOTTAGE'S SECOND RESPONSE: Actually you can clearly see from my review that I do not want everything for free. My problem is different. If we could not understand each other so far, perhaps it's not worth trying any more. So I won't comment on the rest of your answer. All the best!",1,neutral

When it notifies during a phone call using the regular carrier app (not Skype, Hangouts or other app), it buzzes and sends a loud notification that is painful and very disruptive. I sent in a support request 3.5 years ago and they said it shouldn't do that and they were going to ""look into it.""

7824,"● 2019-10-15 EDIT: Just wanted to update my previous reviews to say that the problem I initially encountered seems to have gone away. I don't know exactly when, or how (maybe thanks to an automatic update of the app itself or Android), but TimeTune notifications now happen reliably and on time, just as you would expect, so I'm now upgrading my initial 4 stars to 5 stars—big thanks to the devs! ● 2018-11-05 EDIT: Already in touch with support and testing. After restarting my device it appears to be working, but I will need to test for a few days before I can confirm ● INITIAL REVIEW: App itself is great, but Android keeps closing it after a few minutes of inactivity. As a result, notifications don't happen. I've followed the troubleshooting steps which I was already familiar with and have worked for other apps. just not for TimeTune.

I was hoping to use this as an hourly time management tool, much like a block system, but I can't have it be that AND have my calendar be a place for just appointments. It makes the actual calendar look too full and messy. Basically in short, can you please add an offline tool as well?",1,neutral

So it does see it as a success even though it wasn't for me. Could you maybe implement an option to make it possible to show those as unsuccessful?",2,positive

5215,"One week of use & I purchased a subscription. I've used other similar apps, I enjoy this the most. There a few improvements needed, so I need to add suggestions to the Reddit page. I spent time & wrote out what I value in life, what my aspirations are, & then I narrowed down a few simple goals to reach those aspirations. Then I added my goals to this app. So far it's easy to keep track of my goals, habits, & how I'm doing. It's incredibly easy & even fun to use. Thank you for this app.",2,positive

7397,"Tried it out. The time function, which is 90% of the app IMHO, is clunky. The default ""end"" time is ""until next activity"", but then it automatically changes to the start time of the next activity and you can't change it back. Then, if you add a task that overlaps other start times, it deletes the other activities. I spent 15 minutes setting up a schedule and was frustrated to find that I had erased my entire afternoon schedule because I made a mistake when changing the end time of something mid-day. This app was, for me, ironically, a waste of time.",0,negative
308,"Everything is good. My only issue is that it doesn't send the message to you the exact moment you assigned it. Eg. I set a reminder at 8pm. The BOT only WhatsApped me 15mins later.

It's not useful for my purposes at all. I was hoping it would sync with Google contacts. The alarm is way too loud, and I don't understand how to use it. They deliberately give you the runaround, acting as if they're going to pay you back but they don't.",0,negative
