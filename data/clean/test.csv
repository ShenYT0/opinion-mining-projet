All you get is some minuscule, measly bar graphs which are tiny...and get this, they don't even label the metric you're tracking as they are displayed in the order in which your goal list is. So unless you memorize that goal #7 is say exercise daily, you won't even know what you're looking at. Additionally, the streaks are glitchy as hell, and often times do not calculate correctly. Really wish they also had aggregate goals, for example grouping similar goals together and then tracking the success percent for the aggregate. Like say if you have multiple diet goals for no dairy, no gluten, and no sugar, it would be great to group those in the diet category and then see your success there overall and trending graphs. And come on, add some pie charts and the ability to look at graphs in intervals aside from a single month.",1,neutral

8220,"Is it true that non-premium version soon will loose any way for backup/restore or transfer to another phone? If not true: Please point to me what is the backup/restore way that stays in app in the future. Thanks a lot!. If true: That is really bad news - backup is a basic necessity, so non-premium version will become practically useless on the long term. In addition, premium costs twice as much for a single year than, let's say OsmAnd+ for eternity. And that is a much more complex app + the free version is completely usable within reasonable limits. Tasks is a really nice app (except that swichingt between sublists/lists is unreasonably slow) with some unique and essential features. But this wracks it, it will drive me away. Possibly others too. Not a fair move to reduce base functionality like that. RESPONSE TO STEVEN NOTTAGE'S RESPONSE: That is fair enough, except for one important detail: all the people using your free app are now forced to decide - if they want to have a meaningful app - to pay or search for another app. Premium app should only add features and not restrict free app's capabilities. If you add worthwhile features with a fair pricing, people will buy it. Lots of people spent time to set up their tasking system because the app had the right properties for them, now it looks like they were lured into using the app and then forcing them to pay. I payed for a number of apps (all cheaper than yours btw.), and actually my plan was to pay/donate as soon as the slowness of switching between task lists disappear, because I thought the app is really useful and it deserves support. This change is different. I do not mean you should not ask for payment for cloud backup etc., just that you should not remove the free local backup (or any other feature). Or that you should have omitted it from the free version from the start. Best wishes! RESPONSE TO STEVEN NOTTAGE'S SECOND RESPONSE: Actually you can clearly see from my review that I do not want everything for free. My problem is different. If we could not understand each other so far, perhaps it's not worth trying any more. So I won't comment on the rest of your answer. All the best!",1,neutral

For example, I need to set it to 1 hour and 30 minutes, but there's no option for that. We need the ability to enter exactly the number of minutes and hours we want, instead of only having presets.  EDIT: Now after using it for a while, the app has been plagued with reliability issues. It often is late with the notification by a few minutes, or the service completely stops and I'd have to restart the service. Due to this issue, I cannot rely on this app for anything that is time-sensitive because I'd end up being late for all my appointments and jobs.
